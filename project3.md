# 3D Teeth Scan Segmentation 


Implementation of [MeshSegNet: Deep Multi-Scale Mesh Feature Learning for Automated Labeling of Raw Dental Surface from 3D Intraoral Scanners](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8984309) [1] for automated tooth segmentation and labeling on raw dental surfaces. 
The dataset used for this project is the challenge 3DTeethSeg22 dataset (associated with MICCAI 2022) [2] and is publicly available.

## Code

The code is available on [![GitHub](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tskMh.png) GitHub](https://github.com/hippolytemayard/teeth-3d-mesh-segmentation)


## Dataset

The *3DTeethSeg22_challenge* dataset contains a collection of 3D dental surface scans obtained from intraoral scanners. These scans represent the raw dental surfaces of patients and serve as the input data for the segmentation task. The dataset includes a diverse range of dental conditions and variations, capturing different teeth shapes, sizes, and occlusions. A total of 1800 3D intra-oral scans have been collected for 900 patients covering their upper and lower jaws separately.


## Implementation Details

We base our implementation on MeshSegNet paper [1] as well as the official implementation (see [![GitHub](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tskMh.png) GitHub](https://github.com/Tai-Hsien/MeshSegNet/tree/master)).
